# Growceries
This app allows the user to create an account and have a list of recipes to choose from that they can save. Each recipe shows the ingredients and a tutorial link to the website and/or Youtube link on how to cook that following meal. The user can also save any meals that they like and delete any meals that they dont.
There is also a daily random meal generated to give the user a new meal that they can attempt to make as a way to keep the ooking at home fresh.

### Overview

# Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
